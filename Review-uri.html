				<div class="review a">
					<p>« "Taxi Driver" shouldn't be taken as a New York film; it's not about a city but about the
						weathers of a man's soul,
						and out of all New York he selects just those elements that feed and reinforce his obsessions.
						The man is Travis Bickle, ex-Marine, veteran of Vietnam, composer of dutiful anniversary notes
						to his parents,
						taxi driver, killer. The movie rarely strays very far from the personal,
						highly subjective way in which he sees the city and lets it wound him. »</p>

					<p>« A must-see film for movie lovers, this Martin Scorsese masterpiece is as hard-hitting as it is

					<p>« As a fan of gritty 70s movie-making, I find it hard to believe that, until now, I hadn't seen
						Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver;
						I think perhaps the problem was that, having heard so many good things about the film, I didn't
						want to risk disappointment.
						Unfortunately, that's precisely what I felt when I finally got around to watching the film. »

					<p>« Take a young veteran like Travis Bickle, Schrader’s focal character. A night cabbie, he prowls
						the N.Y. streets until dawn,
						stopping occasionally for coffee with Peter Boyle and some others. He’s been (like most all of
						us),
						deceived by false advertising, phony movie and tv dramaturgy, vote-hungry politicians,
						simplistic and pat morality. An introverted loner
						life makes the complex frustrations more vivid, and the urge to “do something” more strong. Why
						not lash out violently at the
						perceived wrongs in the world? »</p>
